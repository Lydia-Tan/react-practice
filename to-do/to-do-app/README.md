# :blossom: To-Do App :blossom:

Here, I am working on an additional (and somewhat separate) project within the main project. I was trying to make this more organized by separating these two somewhat separate projects and I didn't want to keep making new repos but I'm not sure if this was really very organized or if this was a right decision? Haha... :flushed:

### Phase 1 :bee: 
>Phase 1 will be primarily what I had done in the outermost project -- I will be recreating and essentially starting from scratch adding the checkbox components and to do list card elements
- Render an App component
- Have the app component render 3 or 4 chekboxes with paragraphs or spans next to it
- Hard-coded to-do list items

### Phase 2 :bee:
- Styling (copy-paste, I plan to do a more in depth learning practice with CSS later)
- Create separate component called TodoItem that contains the hardcoded to-do list items 

### Phase 3 :bee:
- currently here!
