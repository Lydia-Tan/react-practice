### Personal logs :mushroom:
>1/12/2021 
So far, I've learned a little bit more with README formatting and I've been getting a better understanding of some of the git commands. i've taken notes reading through branches and pull and push requests. I've also worked through some of the basic exercises with creating props and components in React. I messed up my commit history yesterday but I restored the current code state (missing the commits, though :disappointed:)

>1/13/2021 
Created an app class, reviewed classes and constructors in JavaScript and displayed a simple sample component state. Many of my commits from today and yesterday don't seem to be showing up...

>1/14/2021
Working with modifying and changing object states. I created a faux cookie clicker for practice and I have also seemingly fixed yesterday's issue with my commits now properly showing up as they should. Made some progress with the to-do page as well. Also learned to add gifs to README's -- the possibilities now haha

>1/23/2021 
Learned how to edit component states and implement separate methods and functions. Progress nearly on pause because of classes starting again!
