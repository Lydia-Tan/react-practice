### Personal logs :mushroom:
>1/12/2021 
So far, I've learned a little bit more with README formatting and I've been getting a better understanding of some of the git commands. i've taken notes reading through branches and pull and push requests (what they really mean). I've also worked through some of the basic exercises with creating props and components in React. I messed up my commit history yesterday but I restored the current code state (missing the commits, though :disappointed:)

update: 
I've also only realized now that I need to write the README updates into this local README file in order for it to save these changes when I push to the repo. This is my second time retyping this (oops) because I was actually modifying the README.md file in Github but not here so each time I pushed changes to Github, it would push the old, default README.md file and override the one I had written in Github which is why I had to rewrite this README.md again. But hopefully now, I've identified and solved the issue and won't need to rewrite this file LOL
