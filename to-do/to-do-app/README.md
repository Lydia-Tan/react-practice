# :blossom: To-Do App :blossom:

Here, I am working on an additional (and somewhat separate) project within the main project. I was trying to make this more organized by separating these two somewhat separate projects and I didn't want to keep making new repos but I'm not sure if this was really very organized or if this was a right decision? Haha... :flushed:

### Phase 1 :bee: 
>Phase 1 will be primarily what I had done in the outermost project -- I will be recreating and essentially starting from scratch adding the checkbox components and to do list card elements
- Render an App component
- Have the app component render 3 or 4 chekboxes with paragraphs or spans next to it
- Hard-coded to-do list items

### Phase 2 :bee:
- Create separate component called TodoItem that contains the hardcoded to-do list items 

### Phase 3 :bee:
- Create data file that contains the to do items and assigns values to the task objects
- Implement and display each of the to-do components
- Have the checkboxes change (be checked off) in accordance to the completed boolean value assignment

### Phase 4 :bee:
- Passed the to-do items to be a state object in the class constructor
- Added a console log interaction where the checkboxes could be clicked (state still unchanged) and a console message would result

### Phase 5 :bee:
