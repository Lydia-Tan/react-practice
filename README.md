### Personal logs :mushroom:
>1/12/2021 
So far, I've learned a little bit more with README formatting and I've been getting a better understanding of some of the git commands. i've taken notes reading through branches and pull and push requests. I've also worked through some of the basic exercises with creating props and components in React. I messed up my commit history yesterday but I restored the current code state (missing the commits, though :disappointed:)
