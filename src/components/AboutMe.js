        <h1>Hi, I'm Lydia</h1>
        <p>My brain is a little crazy which might be why I love to turn to creating things -- creating code, art, music, or anything else I can get my hands on. My first creation was a little stick figure illustration of my family. Growing up, my love for illustrating people, capturing expressions and movement, expanded and I fell in love with painting, sketching, and digital art. I started coding in 2017 after I stumbled across a summer program called Kode with Klossy. Perhaps it was the beautiful IDE interface or my thrill with havnig finally learned another language (albeit a code language), but I was quite mesmerized by what I could create. I fell into a rut soon after, though, primarily due to imposter syndrome and perfectionism -- two killer mindsets that, at some point, must have been hijacked and inserted into my brain chip. I'm still trying to counter these cyberattacks on my brain and rewire myself to eliminate these viruses but until then, I'll try to take small steps like these to debug. </p>
        <ul>things that i like about myself
          <li>my desire to improve -- although I'm not very good at many things and can get easily overwhelmed, I think I am always inspired to learn and that is a great trait to have</li>
          <li>my love for the little things -- sometimes I forget to appreciate little moments but at my core, I think I still really value the small moments in my life</li>
          <li>my strength to stay alive -- nothing to add. It's just kinda impressive, what can I say? ;) </li>
          <li>my company -- i don't always like myself (i rarely do, actually) but sometimes, i'm really my only and best companion. Especially when i cry so thank you :)) </li>
          <li>i love being a nerd. i want to be even nerdier -- learn about niche shit and get excited about topics that interest me like gaming or tech things like mechanical keyboards, raspberry pis, idk just anything and everything. i just want to learn and learn and learn and learn. i love it and i love being a nerd</li>
        </ul>
